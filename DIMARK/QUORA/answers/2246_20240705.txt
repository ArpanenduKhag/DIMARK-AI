Standard motorcycle:

1. More rigid frame than scooter. Thus it lasts longer. Most motorcycle has ssymetrical suspensions, sometimes a single shock mounted at the center of the swingarm at the rear. This means even stress at the frame. Many scooters feature a single rear shock mostly mounted on the left side, where the transmission is found, and a single tube suspension on the front (ex. Vespa). This pose instability issues.
2. Bigger wheels. This allows you to zip through uneven pavement or unpaved surfaces with ease than that of scoot. It also helps in stability on higher speeds.
3. Bigger gas tanks. Mostly motorcycle tanks are huge bump between the riders legs just above the engine. This allows for maximum capacity (up to 6gallons on touring bikes.) Than that of scoot which is mounted beneath the saddle. Under the saddle you have to cramp the gas tank, compartment and battery. Imagine whats left space for gas tank.
4. Better mileage. The fact that most motorcycle has manual transmission, you'll get longer journey per liter on it than a scooter of the same displacement. Scooters are automatics. And even on cars, automatics are known as gas guzzlers.
5. Bigger engine is possible on motorcycle. All known superbikes and power cruisers are standard motorcycles. Because of thier design, it is possible to mount big engines of any configuration. V-twins and Vfours, inline fours and six, parallel twins, boxers…. But on a scooter engine size is limited due to the engine is being part of rear suspension. You can have maybe a maximum of 500cc parallel twin. No Vs allowed lol.
Now for Scooters:

1. Easy learning curve. The biggest advantage of scooters is its relatively easy to drive. You just twist the throttle to make the scoot move and grip the brakes to stop. That's why they earned the name “twist and go”. Launching a motorcycle from complete stop is a work of art. But for a scooter its just twist and relax. This setup is very useful in urban traffic where a lot of scoots domain.
2. Storage compartment. Most motorcycle don't have it. You can buy a rear or side box but a scooter is blessed with it a birth. Under the saddle is a compartment (most are weather proof, good for documents) and there is a god sent footboard where you can place groceries.
3. Acceleration. Scoots have smooter acceleration than a traditional manual transmission motorcycle. Because scoots have no actual gears its transition from low to high “gear” is smoother. Therefore they have been praised by their quick acceleration from dead stop. Most noob rider even think scoots are faster than standard bikes (ill answer this in another article, if any one dares to ask lol) due to the feel of sudden spike in acceleration.
4. Relaxed riding. Scooters let you ride in relaxed upright position, with your feet doing nothing!!! They just rest peacefully at the floorboard. And the fact that you don't have to change gears and painfully search for neutral everytime you stop.
5. Protection. Scooters offer added protection to riders compared to standard motorcycle. Your feet rests on the footboard and protected by splash guard. Most scooters have big windscreens which protects the riders from elements like insects and flying debris.
There…i hope you are satisfied with my answer.





I work as a part time teacher and I am a serious student too. Almost all day I live engrossed in my thoughts ranging over the entire academic subjects. Recently I felt the need for purchasing a suitable commuting vehicle exclusively for my commuting needs. Thus I did some research before deciding to go for what suits me the best.I have rode an RE bullet, an Activa, a Pleasure and a Bajaj Caliber 115 very consistently in the past. Thus my verdict reflects the very simple principle of being precise to your purpose before you buy something like this.

Judging from the sense of the question, I am sure that you are inclined towards a vehicle that can serve your routine commuting needs in a city with heavy to moderate traffic flow in all weather conditions.

Automatic scooters are designed specifically for effortless shot rides in heavy traffic and average road build. Average budget Indian road geared motorcycles are mainly a mimic of the true riding feel of a powerful two wheeler machine. They are not actually truly meant for your daily commuting as they do not provide any support for carriage or your random wearing habit.

Any automatic scooter wins over any manual transmission bike in these conditions.

The reasons:

1. The word ‘automatic’ says it all. You don’t have to bear the stress of being mindful about shifting gears during traffic jam. All you need to do is balance, accelerate or brake. I have solved many problems while riding scooters to work as it allows me to think better than demending my attention for every inch it moves.
2. It’s true that automatic transmission won’t give you better mileage than an equal displacement manual transmission, but under heavy traffic conditions, where incorrect shiftings are frequent, automatic proves to be better.
3. You can wear whatever you want… don’t need to dress like a pro rider. Just carry your helmet in any case… and yes… your helmet always can be found safely locked and hidden in the underseat storage… unlike a motorcycle.
Although most motorcycle owners buy their rides keeping in mind the sheer power and range of their vehicles, most of them forget to use those very advantages in the harsh realities of their busy lives.

It is always wiser to spend less but extract the most out of your investment,

Happy Riding!!!





Ah, the age-old debate between the classic bike and the modern gearless scooter – it's like choosing between a trusty old friend and a new, easy-going companion. Let's settle into our usual spot by the window and unravel this together.

Imagine you're zipping through the city streets. On one side, there's the average bike, with its gears and clutch, offering a sense of control and engagement that's hard to match. It's like playing a video game with a manual controller; you feel every shift, every turn, and it's exhilarating. Bikes are known for their higher top speeds and better acceleration, especially when you need that extra oomph to overtake or climb a steep hill.

Now, swing your gaze to the other side, and you'll see the gearless scooter. It's the epitome of convenience. No gears to shift, no clutch to manage – just twist the throttle, and off you go. It's like the automatic setting on your camera; it takes care of the details, so you can focus on the ride. Scooters are fantastic for city life, weaving through traffic with ease, and they often come with added practicalities like under-seat storage and better fuel efficiency.

So, which is better? Well, it depends on what you're looking for. If you crave the engagement and performance of a bike, and you don't mind the extra work with the gears, then the bike might be your ride of choice. But if you're all about convenience, ease of use, and practicality, especially in urban environments, then the gearless scooter could be your new best friend.

And there we have it, a tale of two rides. Each has its charm, its strengths, and its loyal fans. Whichever you choose, it's about the joy of the ride, the freedom of the open road, and the stories you'll tell. So, next time we're out, whether you're on a bike or a scooter, the wind in your hair and the sun on your face, remember – it's not just about the destination, it's about the ride.

The choice between an average bike and a gearless scooter depends on various factors such as personal preference, intended use, convenience, and practicality. Here are some considerations for each:
1. Average Bike:
   - Pros:
2. 
 * Bikes offer a more engaging riding experience for some people. The manual gear shifting can be enjoyable for those who appreciate the control it provides.
 * Bikes generally have better fuel efficiency compared to scooters, especially in the case of smaller engine capacities.
 * Bikes may be more suitable for long-distance rides or for enthusiasts who enjoy the mechanics of riding.

 * Cons:
 * 
 * Riding a bike may require more skill and practice, especially for beginners.
 * Bikes can be more physically demanding, especially in heavy traffic or hilly terrains.
 * Bikes may require more maintenance due to the complex nature of their mechanical components.

1. Gearless Scooter:
   - Pros:
2. 
 * Scooters are generally easier to ride, especially for beginners or those who prefer a simpler driving experience.
 * Gearless scooters are convenient for city commuting and short trips due to their automatic transmission.
 * Scooters often have more storage space under the seat compared to bikes, making them practical for carrying items.

 * Cons:
 * 
 * Scooters may not offer the same level of performance or speed as bikes, especially in situations where higher power is required.
 * Some riders may find scooters less exciting to ride compared to bikes due to their more straightforward operation.
 * Scooters may have slightly lower fuel efficiency compared to bikes with similar engine capacities.

Ultimately, the choice between an average bike and a gearless scooter comes down to your personal preferences, intended use, and comfort level with riding different types of vehicles. It's a good idea to test ride both options if possible to see which one feels more comfortable and suitable for your needs.





I have a Honda Activa and a Yamaha Fz25 (250cc) bike.

I use mostly Activa for office commute as it gives a stressfree ride in Bangalore traffic. No gear change, no clutch, no operation in the legs and zero vibration. It is also useful to carry stuffs like my laptop bag, lunch box, raincoat and extra helmet.

I am a biker at heart and I do use Fz25 on office days sometimes. Even my 3 yr old daughter loves the Fz25 more. She has already learnt to turn on the key, switch the red button and then hit the starter button to turn the engine on. And she demands for her helmet always, be it Activa or FZ ;-)

Comparing a scooty and a bike is like comparing an apple and an orange. Use whatever you need.





Hello friends,

Driving for decades both, small and big I can tell you:

Both will do the job and only your personal preference is the difference.

The pros for scooters are
No Chain, no greasy things ( unless closed drive), Easy driving, automatic, usually more room to put your things in under seat. Better protection from wind ( legs ) under apron, maintenance usually only belt/rollers vs chain & wheels. In general scooters are more practical for moving your groceries, luggage to, especially when you have a flat board.

Maintenance tends to be a little cheaper, but not worth changing to something else

The pro for small Motorcyles

Usually better handling stiffer frames and larger wheels ( easier replacing yourself ), slightly better fuel economy, larger tanks ( up 14 liter, scooters usually half of that). Ability to select gear yourself is sometimes great (hills, wind) Scooters are generally more whobly, but in case you fall I think they separate from you more easy, motorcycles usually fall on your leg when dropped ( own experience ) Scooters have a forced cooling, like fans or watercooled. Scooter may be a little easier to maintain.

Since I drove yamaha cygnus an cygnusx, honda vision 110, ybr 110 and many 50cc and larger motorcycles I can say that FOR ME scooters have a slight edge, certainly newer types like honda vision 110 or honda pcx 125–150 or even yamaha tricity. Very modern, start stop with fuelefficiency up to 1liter 50 Km ( really)

Waiting for a good electric scooter: No fuels, no exhaust,filter oils, plugs……





In general one chooses between a motorcycle and scooter based on their comfort level and purpose.

So let's see the pros and cons of both considering a 100–125cc segment.

1. Comfort and Manuevering - Manuevering through traffic is easier on a scooter due to no constant gear shifts required. But motorcycles are comfortable to ride mainly because of better suspensions they absorb the potholes better than scooters resulting in lesser strain to the rider.
2. Safety - Motorcycles in general have better breaking response than scooters, also as I mentioned in my previous point they absorb potholes better and due to bigger tires they can provide better stability while riding through them or loose gravels. But during an accident it is easier for the rider to jump away from a scooter due to sufficient leg room and also the scooters weight will not be on the rider’s legs after a fall because they are safe within the leg room. But this is not the case with a motorcycle, it is difficult to jump away from a bike and as long as the crash/engine guard is not present in the bike , the bike's weight will come on to the legs during a fall.
3. Usability - Since scooters are easier to ride they can be used by all members of a family and carrying items is much convenient.
4. Mileage - In general the fuel efficiency is better in a geared vehicle compared to automatic be it car or motorcycle.
5. Performance - I have kept this topic to the last because a scooter or an average motorcycle is mainly used for commuting purpose and hence top speed or acceleration is not a priority but still in general the engine refinement, pickup and acceleration is better in a motorcycle compared to a scooter.
So finally it is upto each individual's comfort level and purpose to decide between a motorcycle or scooter.

Hope this helps, good luck!!





I feel it depends on three factors. Distance you need to travel, your age and whether its for single person use. If you are young, have good reflexes and wish to enjoy the ride often, go for a bike. It also helps if u commute long distances a day (over 50 km). Get an automatic scooter if you are a family man, need to carry frequent items with you , someone who is not prone to speeding or if others in your family may need the vehicle. It's more practical. Importantly, a scooter is NOT meant to be a performance machine so you need to keep it below 70 kmph as the wheels, suspension and balance can get tricky when decelerating suddenly frm speeds above this. Skewed weight ratio in the rear make it very likely to fishtail or wobble leading to an eventual crash. Of course, it depends on your skills as a rider too.





If you commute around 50 km a day on decently paved roads an automated scooter would serve you fine ,If you travel more than 50 km on a daily basis on any kind of roads a motorcycle is a safe bet





It completely depends on your requirements.

Gearless scooters are convinient, rider friendly as in you, your siblings, kids, wife, father anybody can ride it. It has storage places to carry your groceries and misc items. Downside is the mileage which Honda has taken care of in its 3G range. Still its not in par with bikes. Current downside is the range of tanks and long distance on scoots are not possible (generalising).

Bikes are good for going the distance and are more comfortable than scooters. But you need boxes or panniers to carry your stuffs. Offers better mileage than same cc scooter counterparts. Has better resale value. Pocket friendly in case you meet with a mishap.

Hope these points can help you narrow down the best bike/scoot you can invest your money in.

Cheers. Thanks for A2A.





Gearless scooters are very practical and convenient, especially if the rider is an Indian female. Practically any dress can be worn while riding it, including skirts and sarees. They also have their mechanical parts concealed, like a car. But they may not be very comfortable, unless the roads are excellent.

The scooter wheels are smaller in diameter than a Motorbike wheels. So, it will go in to most potholes, while a bike wheel will mostly go over it. Because of the larger diameter, a bike tyre will do less revolutions to cover the same distance as a scooter wheel, and will last longer. A bike has longer travel suspensions than a scooter. Also in a bike one will be sitting astride, gripping the fuel tank with the thighs in addition to the grip on the handle bars. Whereas one will sit on the scooter, like sitting on a stool! Because of these reasons, a bike in general is safer than a scooter.

A geared bike with a similar engine capacity as a gear-less scooter will deliver better power and fuel economy. Also due to it’s larger capacity fuel tank as compared to a scooter, you will make less frequent visits to the fuel station.

So, the term “better” depends on what the buyer needs. Try both, and buy the one that pulls your heart strings, while not loosening your purse strings too much!





Pretend that car is a scooter and you have my answer. 







Bike or Scooter..?

Ohh yes, it depends on your requirement, if the person travels more than 60 km per day then you should prefer bike else scooter is much reliable in city. As scooters are gearless and carry groceries, sufficient leg space and comfortable riding. Interesting thing is that no need to keep in mind which gear currently while riding in case of scooter.

Scooter is safer, reliable and easy goods carrier.

Bike is fuel saving as well as time also :)

Finally choice is urs..!! ooh..Enjoy..!!





Depends on what you want it for. 

Bikes: larger fuel tank, larger range, more comfortable seating position, larger wheels (so lesser bumps felt), astride seating position which is more stable, suitable for long-distance touring also, some bikes nowadays equipped with ABS, range of power options to choose from (100cc to 1400cc)

Scooters: More storage space, near footboard, automatic gears for stop and go traffic, ideal for those trips to the market and back.





Recently i purchased a scooter yes because both men and women can easily drive it , it gives u a space to store ur halmet in market or in office need not to carry ur helmet , it geves u a space for in front to keep goods need not to carry a bag every time. Now they are also coming with USB charger.





Both are better at their segments… But still we can differentiate depending upon once usuage atmosphere….

SCOOTY

It's best for day to day usuage in city traffic condition and feels easy to drive in dense traffic condition since there is no clutch and gear shifting.

Practically, we have large boot space for placing groceries or vegetable bags which is hassle free in comparence with bike.

Practically the mileage of Scooty is comparitivey less when compared to gear bikes.

And I suggest to go with Honda brand Scotty for maintenance free and durability.

BIKES

Coming under this…. When you need some performance you can go with gear bikes.

Generally bike are categorised as :

1. Commuter bike
2. Naked bike
3. Sports bike
4. Cruise bike
5. Adventure tourer
If one seeks for good mileage and economic bike for day to day usuage…Obviously you can go for commuter bike.

Naked and sports bike are almost equipped with powerful engine…it's better choice for performance seekers.

Cruise and adventure tourer bikes are best suited for travel blowing people.

I hope this answer will be useful.





Always go for bikes with gears

Scooters have small tires and have more tendency to slip than bikes (had an accident because of a scooter sliped right in front of my bike while changing lane)

Average point of view bikes are better than scooters below 125cc

During a emergency condition we can shift down gears and could possibly minimise the impact of the accident which is not possible in scooters

Purchasing a bike is considered more prestigious here in india (orthodox Mindset ofcourse)

After a major accident the fibre panels of scooter would be shattered whereas in bikes the impact is absorbed by the leg guard and sometimes side lamps.

The only advantage being a scooter can be driven by ladies too





Scooty pros:

1. Boot space.
2. Better handling at traffic as compared to bikes.
3. Less power but effecient fuel economy.
Bike pros:

1. More power.
2. Big wheels which can ignore small potholes.
3. Big fuel tank.
So choose wisely based on your usage.





Scooters are an integral a part of the urban Indian lifestyle. due to their automatic transmissions, they're simple to ride, that makes it appropriate for beginners and for riding in our chaotic traffic while not the else burden of shifting gears. Their generic frame-style ensures that this segment will be employed by men and girls alike, not to mention the ladies who wear ancient consumer goods. Scooters are terribly sensible, with varied storage areas that may facilitate to hold masses safely, in contrast to on a bike.

One space of concern for scooters has invariably been low fuel-efficiency, and with the Republic of India being a mileage-conscious market, this can be a significant downside. whereas the automated transmission systems fitted in earlier scooters were notoriously inefficient, up transmission technology has created the present crop of automatic scooters quite economical, thereby increasing the common mileage.

Some best scooter:

1. Yamaha Ray Z – 53 kmpl

2. Hero Pleasure – 55 kmpl

3. Mahindra Duro DZ – 56.2 kmpl

4. Mahindra Rodeo RZ – 59.3 kmpl

5. Vespa LX125 – 60 kmpl







I don't have either one, so take my answer with a grain of salt.

I would personally go with the bike simply because of the number of moving parts - the greater the number of parts, the greater the likelihood of them breaking down. Bike has less than the scooter (assuming it's a motorized scooter).

If you are riding for pleasure, then bike would allow for a greater physical activity. Yet if the goal is commute - to/from work, for example - then it's all about distance and efficiency, and scooter is the better option.

You would have to get more insights on both methods of getting from point A to point B and do pros/cons list, as well as costs (bike maintenance is cheaper than that of scooter, however scooter allows more convenience in covering larger distances), so it all depends.
