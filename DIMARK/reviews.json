  "1": "If you know exactly what you\u2019re buying, then YES.\n\nAllow me to explain.\n\nA couple of years back I bought a used bike, Yamaha R15 V2.\n\nYou know this one right?\n\nIt was a 2012 manufactured model. Run 8000 kilometers. Single owner. Tires were pretty good, slight scratches on the body. Gives 35 km/l on streets and up to 50 km/l on highways.\n\nThis was the condition when I bought it and I knew what kind of craze people had for this particular sports bike. It was rocking the market at that time.\n\nAfter negotiation, I closed the deal for 66000 rupees.\n\nChanged the registration to my name, used it pretty good for almost 2 years. Long drives often. Tops 142 km/h. Regular maintenance was taken care off.\n\nBy the end, it had run 24000 kilometers, some more scratches, bad tires (stock), 2 owners now, and it was 2017 when I sold which is almost 5 years old.\n\nCalculating the years, depreciation, market value, owners, the condition of the bike and so on\u2026how much did I sell this bike for?\n\n71000 rupees.\n\nNow, if I had bought any other brands or model, I\u2019m not sure if I could sell it without much loss, let alone any profit!\n\nSo my advice would be, know what you\u2019re buying. It doesn\u2019t matter if you throw another 10k for the bike you love. Ultimately, quality and comfort matter. Always go for quality build bikes like RE, Honda or Yamaha. When you resell, the loss is way too less when compared to buying a new one and reselling it after few years.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nThank you for reading!",
  "2": "Buying a secondhand bike or two-wheeler can be a good idea for many people, depending on their specific circumstances and priorities. Here are some factors to consider when deciding whether buying a used bike is a good choice for you:\n1. Cost Savings: One of the primary reasons people opt for a used bike is the cost savings. Generally, used bikes are significantly cheaper than brand new ones, allowing you to get a better model or a higher-end bike for the same budget.\n2. Depreciation: New vehicles depreciate quickly in value in the first few years of ownership. By buying a used bike, you avoid this initial depreciation hit, which means that the value of the bike is likely to hold up better over time.\n3. Insurance and Registration Costs: Insurance and registration costs for a used bike are usually lower than for a new one, which can translate into further savings for you.\n4. Variety: When buying a used bike, you have a wider range of models and makes to choose from since you can consider older models that may no longer be in production.\n5. Condition and Maintenance: It's important to thoroughly inspect a used bike before purchasing to ensure that it's in good condition. Consider factors such as mileage, service history, any signs of wear and tear, and whether any major repairs are needed. Maintenance costs may be higher for an older bike, so factor this into your decision.\n6. Reliability: While many used bikes can offer reliable performance, there is always a risk of buying a bike that may have hidden issues or require more frequent repairs. It's a good idea to have a mechanic inspect the bike before purchasing to identify any potential problems.\n7. Warranty and Guarantees: Unlike new bikes that often come with warranties, used bikes generally do not have these protections. Make sure to understand the terms of the sale and any guarantees provided by the seller.\n8. Resale Value: Consider the potential resale value of the bike when you decide to sell it in the future. Some models hold their value better than others, so research this aspect as well.\nIn conclusion, buying a secondhand bike can be a good idea for many people, especially if you are looking to save money or have a limited budget. However, it's essential to do thorough research, inspect the bike carefully, and consider all the factors mentioned above to ensure that you make a wise investment.",
  "3": "Let me share my experience with buying a secondhand two-wheeler. My stand on this topic would be a little clearer this way.\n\nI wanted a two wheeler for daily commute to office. This was going to be my first vehicle and I didn\u2019t have much experience riding one (I had a license though. I used to ride my friend\u2019s bike). I had around 20k as savings so I thought it\u2019s better to buy a second hand scooty and keep saving money to buy a nice bike after a year or so. The plan seemed rigid to me. I searched on Olx and found a decent Honda Activa 2009 model at 17k, but someone told me this price is too much for such an old model. They told me I can get a better price from local second hand bike market (Worst advice I ever got).\n\nI went to the market and after searching for a day, I finalized on a red color Suzuki Access 2012 model for Rs 27,500. This scooty was the best choice among all the vehicles that I rode. Indicator and speedometer were not working so the shop keeper suggested me to give the bike for a general service and then all will be fine. I bought it on 27th September, 2016.\n\nThis is how it looked before I sold it.\n\nFollowing are all the expenses that I bore on this scooty. At least the ones that I remember.\n\nSeptember 2016\n\nGot the speedometer and indicators fixed. \u20b9300. [Mechanic A]\n\nOctober 2016\n\nGot a puncture in rear wheel. The guy told me it\u2019s better to replace the Tyre. So I replaced it with a tubeless Tyre. \u20b91700.\n\nI gave my scooty for a general servicing to local mechanic. He fixed some minor issues and changed Engine oil. The front mudguard was making sound. Total Cost was \u20b9700. [Mechanic A]\n\nI was about to leave for office one morning and rear wheel refused to move. It was jammed. Gave it to a different mechanic this time. He said something was wrong with clutch and all. Costed me \u20b91600 this time. [Mechanic B]\n\nIn last week of October, while returning from office, I sensed that the engine is making too much of jarring noise. Got it checked from a local repair shop. He told me there is no oil in engine (Almost 5 days after last service). He didn\u2019t have fresh engine oil so for the time being he topped it up with used engine oil (Oil that is drained from other vehicles during oil change). Charged me \u20b9200 for it. I went back home to my known mechanic and asked him how come engine oil was over in just 5 days. He checked the vehicle and told me oil is getting burnt. Smoke was coming out from exhaust. It would require a major fix(opening the engine). I had no money left to get it fixed. I also told him how previous mechanic added used engine oil, so he changed the oil again. \u20b9280 for oil change this time. [Mechanic B]\n\nNovember 2016\n\nGot my salary. I gave my bike for the major work to him [Mechanic B]. He was supposed to give it back in 3 days. 3rd day he told me there are a lot of things wrong and he needs 2 more days. Finally he returned my scooty on 8th November,2016 (Demonetization Day) . He charged me 7000 rupees for it. I had just returned from office and gave him a dozen of 500 rupee notes. He had no clue about demonetization, neither did I.\n\nA few days later, while I was returning from office late (9 PM), the scooty stopped abruptly. I had just covered 1 km from office. Tried to start it but it didn\u2019t work. Some people passing by tried to kick start the scooty but no success. All shops were closed (also I had no cash. Demonetization Zindabad). Finally I dragged the scooty back to office and went home in Cab. Next day I called that same mechanic [Mechanic B] and explained him everything. He told me to bring the bike to him (Bring my dead bike from office to his garage, 23 km). I told him to come to office or send one of his mechanic but he said they can only come there in the evening. So I got it fixed from a local mechanic near my office. Costed me \u20b9300. It was an electrical problem. [Mechanic C]\n\nDecember 2016\n\nThe scooty was far from fixed after that major engine work. After riding for 10 km, I could hear a noticeable sound of piston moving. It was crazy. But now I was tired of putting money into the scooty repairs. I just kept riding it. Sometimes it wouldn\u2019t start after stopping at a signal (It is really embarrassing). In December I made a few repairs regarding the same issue. He changed the spark plug. Speedometer cable broke again along with the buzzer that runs indicators. (I was starting to understand all these technical words now).\n\nOverall it costed me around 1500 rupees.[Back to Mechanic A]\n\nJanuary 2017\n\nThe front mudguard which used to make sound had broken off completely. It was now hitting the front wheel. I had to get it changed. Costed me \u20b92400.\n\nThe scooty was again giving starting trouble. I told the mechanic to clear the carburetor and spark plug (\u20b9100 work), but he told me the spark plug broke in two parts while taking it out. We will have to replace it. (\u20b9400). [Mechanic A]\n\nFebruary 2017\n\nSpeedometer cable broke again, however I had no intention to getting it fixed. The piston sound that usually came after riding 10 km had become really loud. It was very irritating. Mechanic said it would be a really costly thing to fix. I kept riding it like that. [Mechanic A]\n\nFinally bought a new bike. I had saved enough money to buy a new Bajaj Dominar 400. However, I had little confidence to ride such a heavy bike in full traffic. So I kept riding the scooty for office commute.\n\nMarch 2017\n\nI was riding scooty throughout the month. The sound got really unbearable. It again started giving trouble while starting. One day after returning home, It just didn\u2019t start. I started using my bike since then.\n\nJuly 2017\n\nI finally decided to sell my scooty on Olx. I got it in running condition on with a final servicing of \u20b91800 [Mechanic D]. I was asking around 19k for it. Buyers would come but the piston sound was too loud. Finally a buyer bought it for 17k. The story didn\u2019t end here. Buyer had a really bad experience with it as well. I returned him 2k for all the inconvenience. (Sometimes I really feel bad about selling this scooty to him)\n\nIn conclusion, I paid more than 23k on scooty repair. I have had a very bad experience with mechanics. It\u2019s not that mechanics at Bajaj service centers are any good. Now I am more cautious and careful about giving my bike to any mechanic. Will I suggest anyone to buy a second hand vehicle? Well, I will tell them to avoid it. Only buy from someone you know. Someone whom you trust. Stay away from brokers and middlemen. Do thorough check of the vehicle. Take some mechanic or a knowledgeable friend if you don\u2019t know much about second hand vehicles. Don\u2019t believe anything that the seller might say about any issue you observe.\n\nIn short, try to avoid buying a second hand vehicle from unknown people. If you really have to, be very very careful and check each and everything. Slightly higher price for a well maintained vehicle is better than a cheap vehicle at less price.",
  "4": "You can purchase a second-hand two wheeler if you want but you need to check on a few factors before making your purchase. Sometimes, the vehicles are damaged and a lot of money needs to be spent in order to bring the vehicle in the proper condition. You need to check the following factors while purchasing second-hand vehicles.\n\n1. Engine \n2. Trip Meter\n3. Kilometer Driven\n4. Fuel Tank \n5. Clear paper work which includes insurance, RC Book, Bike papers\n6. Condition of the bike \n7. Signal lights, horn and bike condition\n\nYou can also go for a test ride in order to check the condition of the bike before purchasing it. You also need to check the mileage that the bike offers. Even if it is a second-hand bike, you need to maintain it and get it serviced regularly.\n\nHope this helps!",
  "5": "Yes, its Good Idea, so that you hands on it practice more.\n\nWhat needs to be checked is the\n\n1. Engine\n2. Km Drive\n3. Trip Meter\n4. Fuel Tank\n5. Clear Paper Work (Bike Papers, Rc, Book, Insurance)\n6. Bike Condition.\n7. Digital Speedometer and Signal Lights.\nDrive at Low speed for the First Time and check the Actual Average and Mileage that bike delivers and then make it Rough Ride.\n\nAll the best\u2026..",
  "6": "Usually I am against the idea of buying 2nd hand stuff(No I am not a rich man) but if you have the knowledge of the machine and you can judge the condition of the bike by yourself, it would be a good idea.",
  "7": "My friend bought old model Hero Hunk from a local second hand bike seller.\n\nHe would go for long travels most time. Whenever he takes me along, he complains about some or the other problems with the bike.\n\nHe takes it to mechanic for too many times.He sometimes repairs on his own whenever the mechanic seems to be busy, using his tools.Since my friend is a mechanical engineer.\n\nEven-though the bike gives him trouble, he does not worry about that.Possibly.\n\nSo I recommend that do not buy second hand bikes unless you know something about the bike or have a good friend like me. Do not trust alone your local mechanic, you may be wasting your money.",
  "8": "Yes and no.\n\nYes if you have knowledge and patience to restore it to pristine condition and it isn't your primary ride.\n\nNo if you are bussy and don't know anything about 2 wheelers. You don't have company warranty to rescue you.",
  "9": "Buying a second hand motorbike is the best way to go. You lose a ton of cash the moment you ride a new bike away from the dealer. You also need to ride a new bike below certain rev ranges for certain miles in order to \u201cbreak the engine in\u201d - if you want something fairly new pick up something that\u2019s already done a couple of thou and the boring work has already been done for you! \ud83d\ude09\n\nThings to look out for are:\n\n\u201cIs the bike stolen\u201d? - check the vin number against the paperwork. Make enquiries about the bike online to ensure it isn\u2019t stolen before bothering to even see it with a reg check.\n\nIf you accidentally buy a stolen bike and the police pick it up you are the one who will have it confiscated with no rebate.\n\nCheck the engine over for any signs of oil leaks.\n\nCheck for signs the bike has been dropped - scrape marks dents etc - if yes the carefully check the engine casing to make sure there are no cracks.\n\nCheck the handlebars are straight. Check for frame damage, excessive rust etc.\n\nPut the front wheel straight and with the bike on its stand, look at the bike from the rear wheel to the front and check it looks in line.\n\nCheck the fork seals aren\u2019t leaking.\n\nSit on the bike and push it backwards and forwards with the front brake engaged - does it make a clunking sound? If so fork bearing might be on its way out.\n\nCheck tyres obviously\n\nCheck brake pads and brake fluid levels. Test the brakes function.\n\nCheck what the oil looks like - if any whiteish discolouring it has been contaminated with water - dont bother buying it unless it\u2019s aomething you are willing to spend a lot of time on as a project bike.\n\nCheck what the coolant looks like - if sludge then it\u2019s not necessarily the end of the world but make sure you change it out and possibly be prepared to put some cleaning fluids through as well.\n\nCheck the radiator and coolant pipes for signs of leakage\n\nCheck the chain and sprocket condition (if the rear sprocket is all sharp and pointy and \u201cwave\u201d shaped the it will need a new sprocket and chain set (not the end of the world but an additional expense you will need to make)\n\nCheck that every electronic function on the bike works.\n\nDoes the bike start easily?\n\nLook at the bikes service history.\n\nIf you live in the U.K. you can check the entire MOT history online via the number plate - just google \u201cMOT check\u201d. (Other countries may do similar services?)\n\nChecking the online MOT history is definitely a good idea, because the seller (or previous seller) may have changed the clocks on the bike and the bike you thought had only done 20,000 miles has actually done 140,000 miles! Online MOT certs can\u2019t be forged either.\n\nFinally definitely test ride the bike before buying it - you may notice oddities in the engine sound or strange handling issues that are red flags not to buy that bike!\n\nIf you buy a second hand bike from a reputable dealer you will usually get some warranty on that bike as well, and the bike is likely to be in a good roadworthy condition, you will however be paying extra for that privelage and it is cheaper to buy privately and you can often find bargains (I picked up a street triple for \u00a31500 with only 20K on it as \u201cspares or repairs\u201d because it wouldn\u2019t start for instance - it was just the starter motor and works great now! - thoroughly check out what you are buying first as above though so you can make a list of additional expenses that might be required to sort the bike out afterwards and know the true cost of what you are actually buying!\n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of from the top of my head at the mo, but I\u2019m sure others will add.\n\nHappy hunting! \ud83d\ude0e",
  "10": "Look for signs of damage from the bike being dropped.\n\nWorn grips and footrest rubbers indicate a high mileage.\n\nCheck the history - many bikes have multiple owners which is an increased risk.\n\nCheck history for free on DVLA website, including MOT'S, but get a full HPI check before you buy.\n\nIt's probably better to buy from a dealer for the warranty, unless you are very confident.\n\nDon't buy without a test ride, which is a major risk.",
  "11": "Not at all a bad thing! That is what I suggest to all new riders (although, I don\u2019t know if you are a new rider, or just looking for a different bike). Do have the bike checked out by either a certified mechanic, or someone you trust that is REALLY good with wrenching on bikes.\n\nIf the current owner of the bike has all the paperwork for past maintenance, work done on the bike, etc., that\u2019s good to have as well. You can also do a VIN check on the bike, much like people do when they want to buy a new car. It will tell you if the vehicle has been salvaged or in a flood, etc., (less reliable sellers will try to cover these things up with new paint, etc)\n\nGood luck!\n\nLT",
  "12": "Buy a used bike in the following scenarios-\n\n1. You don't know to ride a bike.\nIf you're yet to learn how to ride, then there are good chances that you might fall or scrape things. Even if not, you will use the clutch-gear-accelerator in wrong way. Which will harm the bike and its engine.\n\n2. You have budget constraints.\n\nDo remember that in most cases- more you pay, better you get. But since that is the constraint, it's better to go for the used one if you really need one. Try to buy less used and relatively new bike. Buy a bike with less cc which is cheaper to buy, own and maintain. But bear in mind that used bike will need frequent visit to service station compared to new.\n\n3. You're not going to use it for more than 2 years.\n\nTime flies. So does 2 years. New bike value will depreciate a lot in the initial years. So it makes sense of buy a used bike in this case and sell it later at little lesser amount.\n\n4. You are getting a really good deal on a used bike.\n\nIf you are finding a great deal from your friend/family on the used vehicle then you can consider provided- you know the bike, is relatively new, is in good condition and you like that bike.\n\nIn other good cases- Buy a new bike.\n\nWhy?\n\n1. Price difference between used and new bike is less unlike cars.\n2. You have the freedom to choose the model you love. That is too in the color you like!\n3. For the extra money you pay- you get the peace of mind. You don't need to worry about the previous ownership, defects\u2026 Etc. Even if the new bike has any fault it will be repaired free of cost.\n4. New bike will have better brakes, better stability, planted tyres, better suspensions and new technologies. Which will save you in panic situations. On road any thing can happen. And you know- safety is above all. What's the point, if you save 30k and spend 30k at hospital.\n5. New bike feel. It's pleasure- to go and bring a new bike from showroom, to ride on a smooth engine and to flaunt to your friends ;)\nIf you don't look back at your bike after you park it, you've bought the wrong bike. Fact!",
  "13": "The choice of buying between a new motorcycle or a second-hand vehicle is not an easy one. A two-wheeler is one of the most convenient modes of transportation that can fit narrow roads and lanes and benefit you from speedy distance coverage. However, how do you know whether it is worth buying a second-hand bike or not? There are multiple benefits of buying a second-hand bike in Bangalore and they are as follows.\n\nBenefits\n\n * The used bikes for sale in Bangalore are less expensive as compared to the new motorbike but still offer similar mileage and quality.\n * Multiple outlets sell pre-owned bikes in Bangalore [ https://beepkart.com/second-hand-bike/buy/bangalore ] and so if you go to buy a second-hand two-wheeler, you will benefit from great seller choice as you can pick and choose as per your convenience.\n * Lastly, you will also benefit from a lower insurance premium as the age of the bike or the second-hand two-wheeler will be older as compared to a new model that you purchase from the market.\n",
  "14": "The first thing to look for is papers. Whether all the documents are there and up to date. This includes the RC book (or sheet) Insurance and pollution (not a big deal as pollution check costs less).\n\nNext thing is the condition of the bike.\n\n * Visual inspection for scratches. The scratches in silencer and handlebar end-weights is a giveaway if the bike had a fall.\n * Check for rusts. This could be in the tank (leaking tank is a big issue and seen in many second hand bikes) Check the fuel tank after taking the seat off, as this area rusts fast. Check the silencer (underside) for rusts as well. A tank is an expensive replacement and is too risky to be repaired.\n * Battery. Self start the bike and turn on Headlights in high beam + horn at the same time. A distorted horn could mean weak batteries.\n * Tire condition. Worn out tires can cost you 3K+ to replace.\n * Handle. Keep the bike in full stand, Rotate the tire and see if it moves in a straight line. Also keeping the front wheel free from ground, move the handle to both ends and back. See if it moves freely, if not it is a cone and ball issue\n * Engine. Switch on the engine, idle it and see if the rpm gauge keeps on fluctuating. It's indicative of bad tuning/ carburetor issues. Watch out for engine idle noise as well. \u2018Click\u2019 and \u2018ticks\u2019 could mean tappet issues.\n * Alignment. Ride the bike, take your hands off handle/hold it very lightly and see if it still moves in straight line.\n * Clutch. Rev the bike in short bursts while riding. If the engine revs/rpm gauge goes up, but you\u2019re not getting the pick-up/acceleration, it\u2019s a worn clutch. Repeat this multiple times to confirm.\n * Chain sprocket: Maintain normal speeds at a straight stretch and try engaging clutch, or switch to neutral and let the bike flow. The engine noise should be minimal now. An irregular chain noise means a worn out chain sprocket. This can also be checked by putting on full stand and visually inspecting one point of chain while spinning the rear wheel.\nP.S. Please note that, if you looked at one bike and felt like your heart wants it, none of this is a deal breaker. For a regular two wheeler (that means a commuter or within 250cc range and not a superbike/premium one), most of these issues can be fixed at the hands of a decent mechanic. You just have to calculate the repair costs involved and negotiate for an attractive price.",
  "15": "Its depend upon the condition. If you get a nice one with good condition you can go ahead and buy it. But try to negotiate as much as you can because if you keep this for sale probably you will end-up by having peanuts in hand.",
  "16": "Why not?\n\nBuying a third-hand bike can be a great option depending on various factors. If the bike has been well-maintained and is in good condition, it can offer excellent value for money. However, it's essential to thoroughly inspect the bike for any signs of wear and tear, such as rust, frame damage, or mechanical issues.\n\nAdditionally, consider the reputation of the seller and whether they can provide any maintenance records or history of the bike. Ultimately, if the bike meets your needs, fits your budget, and you're confident in its condition, purchasing a third-hand bike can be a wise choice.",
  "17": "It is always better to buy a used vehicle, you will save money and resources of the planet. Only thing is you have to go through the difficulty of searching the market and dealing. Yes, you would also need a little knowledge about vehicles or else you could be fooled which can also be dealt by taking a knowledgable person with you. But once you find your choice trust me you\u2019ll be happy, you just need to know the condition and any repairing cost if it needs.\n\nBuying a new vehicle is not only waste of your own money but also the resources of the planet. Just think of every person buying a new vehicle which is already being usually practised, the manufacturing process it needs to go through and the raw materials needed to build one plus the pollution you will already create with whatever you buy, why would you want to hurt the nature more?",
  "18": "Buying a second hand bike is good if u buy it from genuine buyer\n\nIn India we have some good place like credr where u can trust when ur buying the bike\u2026 I recently one bike from there I'm very happ with the bike.",
  "19": "Heavily depends on the condition of the bike. If you personally know the rider and have seen how he takes care of the bike, then go ahead. Else, if the bike is a classic and hold its value in coming future, then its also a good proposition.\n\nIf you personally don\u2019t know anything about bike. Better to take a mechanic who knows the bike and can give you unbiased view on the bike\u2019s condition.\n\nElse, better to steer clear of the bike. Many third hand bikes are abused and go for dirt cheap prices.\n\nHope this helps. Thanks for A2A.",
  "20": "Your better off buying from an individual if, you research the particular bike so you know what it's worth, don\u2019t let emotions influence your decision. Do a really critical examination to determine how used it is. Unless it is rare or unique at a seemingly low price, don\u2019t bring money with you. The extra time that gives you is an opportunity to make a sober decision without the flashy color tugging at your heartstrings. that can save you from a bad decision. If you don\u2019t know much about bikes, get someone who does to determine it\u2019s mechanical state. The things to look for are, worn chain and sprockets, dirty oil, oil leaks, are the forks straight? Is the tank reasonably clean? Corrosion, damaged rims or spokes, clapped out tires, electrics work ok? All this stuff is easy to determine on older bikes without all the plastic. Buying a clapped out bike thinking \u201c if I restore this, it will be really cool! \u201c can be a huge mistake. Most bikes aren't worth the cost of restoration. If it is something you really desire, try to find one that\u2019s already sorted."
